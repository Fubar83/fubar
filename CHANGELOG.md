# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project aims to follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial side-by-side file comparison: pick two files (or pass them on the command line) and see them
  aligned, with line numbers and per-line change highlighting.
- Placeholder rows opposite insertions and deletions, and a single shared scroller, so the two panes
  cannot drift out of alignment.
- Next / previous change navigation, wrapping at both ends.
- Comparison options: ignore whitespace, ignore case, and JSON/XML structure normalization (which
  falls back to a plain text diff when the content does not parse).
- Encoding and line-ending detection (UTF-8 / UTF-16 BOMs, CRLF / LF / CR), a 64 MB size cap, and
  rejection of binary files with a readable reason.
- Dark / light theme switching at runtime, from the shared `Fubar.Controls` design system.
- Clean layered architecture (Core / Application / Infrastructure / UI) with a NetArchTest suite
  enforcing it, including that DiffPlex stays confined to Infrastructure.
